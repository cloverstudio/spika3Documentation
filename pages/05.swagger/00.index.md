# Swagger sample

Here are some swagger samples. The best npm I can use to build html from swagger yaml is [swagger-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui), which is official repository from OpenAPI.
The problem was this library requires build from webpack. So I have to put generated source code programatically and call webpack build also programatically.


You can see how it works to read this part of the code.
```typescript
const buildSwaggerUI = (doc: Document, dist: string, templatePath: string): Promise<void> => {
```

Basically it works ( I hope ), so you can use swagger file to make beautiful API document.

I put some samples in this folder so please check how it looks.
